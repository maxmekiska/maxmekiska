## Hi there!

I'm Max, a passionate engineer with a specific interest in machine learning.

### Main Projects

#### imbrium

imbrium is a deep learning library that specializes in time series forecasting. Its primary objective is to provide a user-friendly repository of deep learning architectures for this purpose. The focus is on simplifying the process of creating and applying these architectures, with the goal of allowing users to create complex architectures without having to build them from scratch. Instead, the emphasis shifts to high-level configuration of the architectures.

#### fukkatsu

fukkatsu is a python library designed for experimental purposes, empowering code with the ability to mutate, self-repair and adapt during runtime as needed. This capability is achieved by harnessing the potential of large language models.
